# DOM-pig-Game
Pig Game made in Vanilla JS. 

This Branch is the dev Branch where we are going to make a pull request to out master branch to later merger our pull request.

Adding some Rules: 

If you roll 1 you wont get any points to hold and it will be the other players turn. 

If you roll other numbers except 1 you will have each roll added to your hold and when you think you're out of luck you press the hold label to collect your points. 

First player to 100 wins.

May the best player win.
